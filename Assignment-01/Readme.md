## Image Quality Evaluation

This Python script assesses the quality of a degraded image with respect to an original face image. Three degradation methods are applied:

1. **Blur:**
   - The image is blurred using Gaussian blur.

2. **Compression and Decompression:**
   - The image is compressed to JPEG2000 format and then decompressed.

3. **Gaussian Noise:**
   - Gaussian noise is added to the image.
