# Geometric Transformations on Gray Scale Image

This repository contains code to apply various geometric transformations on a grayscale image without using inbuilt functions. The transformations include Translation, Scaling, Rotation, Shearing in X-direction, and Shearing in Y-direction.

## Transformations to be Applied

- **Translation:** Move the image along both the x and y axes by a specified distance.
- **Scaling:** Enlarge or shrink the image by a specified scaling factor along both the x and y axes.
- **Rotation:** Rotate the image by a specified angle about its center.
- **Shearing in X-direction:** Distort the image along the x-axis by a specified shear factor, leaving the y-axis unchanged.
- **Shearing in Y-direction:** Distort the image along the y-axis by a specified shear factor, leaving the x-axis unchanged.

## Instructions

1. **Download Lena Image:** 
   - Obtain the Lena image from any online source or use your own.

2. **Convert to Gray Scale:** 
   - Convert the image to grayscale.

3. **Implementation of Geometric Transformations:** 
   - Implement each transformation separately.

4. **Testing:** 
   - Visualize and verify the transformed images.
